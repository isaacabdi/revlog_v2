## Overview

This project involves deploying a Python-based API on an AWS EC2 instance, setting up Prometheus and Grafana locally (using Docker) for monitoring, and writing a Python automation script.

## Project Goals

1. **Deploy and Monitor an API**: Install and configure a Python API on AWS EC2, and set up Prometheus and Grafana locally to monitor API metrics.
2. **Metric Visualization**: Use Grafana to create dashboards for monitoring API metrics.
3. **Scripted Automation**: Write a Python script to automate interaction with the API, including authentication, error handling, and data tracking. (Use wait()s and keep it to a reasonable amount of requests per second!)
