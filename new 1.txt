aws instance
- linux 2 aws instance with the default free tier settings
- considerations

- ssh key authenication, basic security feature that prevents unauthorized ssh access to the instance with the use of private key credentials, 

- Restricted inbound access to the instance, modify the security group to only accept inbound traffic from whitelisted ip addresses, on port 22, and port 5000

- alerts and monitors, used aws cloudwatch, to monitor the total cost of my aws billing across my instances, and send an alert if it goes over a certain dollar threshhold
it would then trigger a lambda function to stop the instance.

the ec2 instance essentially functions as the server the flask api is hosted on,
while our local python script, acts as the client, simulating the process of making requests to the Flask API
